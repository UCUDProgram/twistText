Installed an application called, pspell, via command line
pspell is an application that says whether a word is a word or not
    Returns a boolean based on it being a word

Following three lines are command arguments to get pspell
    -- sudo apt-get install libpspell-dev 
    -- sudo apt-get install php5-pspell
    -- sudo apt-get install aspell-en

In php file, rack.php, I used the application to check each potential word, to see if it is a word
